# Canceling an EVault service

You can cancel your EVault service at any time. The cancellation deletes your vault with the backed-up data and you can't log in to WebCC with the canceled EVault credentials.

1. Log in to the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} with your unique credentials.
2. Go to **Storage** > **Backup**. 
3. Select **Actions** > **Cancel EVault**.
4. Choose to cancel **Immediately** or on the **Anniversary Date**.
   >**Note** - You can cancel the service anytime. However, when a backup vault is deleted before the end of the monthly billing cycle, there is no refund.
5. Select **Continue**.
6. Check that **I acknowledge that due to cancellation data loss may occur**. Then, select **Cancel EVault**.
