# Changing the Password for an EVault Backup Service

## Overview

Each EVault backup service has an associated password that is used to access EVault within WebCC. 

For many {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} products and services, the password storage feature within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} is used solely for storage or tracking of the password, and changes made to the password within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} aren't applied to the product or service. It's **not** the case for EVault backup. 

Changes made to the EVault backup password within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} will be made to the service itself. Change your password while keeping in mind that it will impact your service directly.

## Change an EVault backup password

1. Access the EVault backup screen on the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} by clicking **Storage** > **Backup**.
2. Click anywhere on the row for the wanted EVault backup to expand the view.
3. Click the **Show** check box to view the current password.
4. Enter the new password in the **Password** field.
5. Click **Update**.
