# Installing the EVault Bare Metal Restore Plug-in

EVault BMR is a disaster recovery solution for Microsoft Windows that enables you to completely restore your server from a bare metal state after a disaster, such as an operating system or hardware failure, occurred. This system allows you to quickly restore the system image from a safe, secure location that is managed by {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}}.

**Note**: BMR is a Microsoft Windows only product on physical servers. It is not available for virtual servers. Bare Metal Restores for Linux distributions aren't supported. BMR is only supported by EVault Agent 8.30 or earlier versions. (30 June 2018).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I move from a single disk to a raid array?

Yes, that works. However, you need to select a large capacity device due to the size decrease the raid array causes.

### What happens when I restore the image to a larger disk than the original volume?

If you restore the image to a larger disk than the original volume, the left over space is deallocated. So for example - when you have a 500 GB drive and restore its data to a 1 TB disk, you end up with 500 GB of deallocated disk space. With windows 2008, you can use the built-in disk utility to grow the primary partition. However, there isnâ€™t a similar built-in capability in windows 2003, so you must allocate the space another way.

### Can I use BMR for my regular Backup?

BMR backup isn't a disk image, but a system volume image backup system. The system isn't intended to be used for regular backups, but along with them.  

### Can I use BMR for my Database Backups?

Database backups must be made separately with the normal EVault backup methods. BMR doesn't replace the need for SQL or Oracle plug-ins. Though BMR uses the VSS technology to backup open files, we can't always guarantee that the backed-up files are transaction consistent. Our recommendation for these types of specialized applications is that you create two backup jobs: one to back up OS and application binary files and another one for application data. There's a note to this effect at the end of the BMR user guide.

### What kind of restore jobs can I run with BMR?

You can either do a whole system restore, or you can pick individual files from the backup to restore. The BMR backup job can replace your current files backup job. The restore process is done inside the OS, just like a traditional backup job.

### Does BMR have open file Back up capabilities?

BMR has open file back up capabilities. However, BMR doesn't replace the need for SQL or Oracle plug-ins. Click [here](evault-mssql-plugin.html) for the MSSQL plug-in installation instructions.

### How much disk space and time does a BMR restore take?

A backup that is made from a default installation uses about 6 GB. Such a restore would take around 15 minutes on a 1 GB port. This process is also affected by private port speed. If you need faster backups/restores, a port speed increase might be needed.
