# Expanding EVault Capacity

Current {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} users are able to expand the size of their Vault up to 4000 GB. They don't need to create a duplicate or manually migrate data to a larger volume. Thereâ€™s no outage or lack of access to the vault while the limit increase takes effect.

## Ordering an increase

1. Access the EVault backup screen on the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} by clicking **Storage** > **Backup**.
2. Select the EVault you want to extend.
3. Click **Actions**, and select **Modify EVault**.
4. On the next screen, select the new size and click **Upgrade**.

## Billing

Billing for the volume is automatically updated to add the pro-rated difference of the new price to the current billing cycle. Then, the full new amount is billed in the next billing cycle.

**Note**: the same process can be used to downsize your EVault.
