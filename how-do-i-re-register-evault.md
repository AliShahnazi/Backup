This is most commonly a step needed after reloading the OS of a server, but you can also use these steps to use backups for one server, to restore on another server.

1. Login as the user on WebCC. Refer to the [Getting Started with Backup Services](/docs/infrastructure/Backup/index.html) document for more details.

2. Click **All Agents** on the left under Views.

3. Mouse-over **Edit **in the top right corner of the screen.

4. Select **Vault Settings**.

5. Click **Reregister**.

6. Fill out: Vault Name, Vault Address, Account, User Name, Password.

**Note**: "Account" is the "Account Name" in the [Getting Started with Backup Services](/docs/infrastructure/Backup/index.html) page. Typically, it is "SLE[account id]"

7. Click **Load Computers** and select which computers you wish to load.

8. Click **Save Changes**.
