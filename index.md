# Getting started with EVault backup services

Backups ensure that your data is safely stored outside of your device and protected if it's lost. EVault Backup is an automated agent-based backup system that is managed through the EVault WebCC browser-based management utility, providing users with a method to back up data between servers in one or more data centers on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} Network. Administrators can set backups to follow an hourly, daily, weekly, or custom schedule that targets full systems, specific directories, or even individual files. Additional plug-ins allow for compatibility with software like Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft SQL, as well as other types of third-party software and enables users to perform a Bare Metal Restore, when necessary.

## Ordering EVault 

There are two ways to purchase EVault backup service:

- Purchase EVault when Ordering a Server
- Purchase EVault as an Upgrade

### Purchase EVault when ordering a server

1. Log in to [The IBM Cloud catalog](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/){:new_window} or the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}
2. Order a monthly bare metal server. You can learn more about ordering bare metal servers [here](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/bare-metal/baremetal-provision.html){:new_window}.
3. You are redirected to the manage portal to complete the order. <br/>
  **Note**: EVault backup service isn't available when ordering an hourly billed server. However, the service can be added later as an upgrade. 
4. Under **Add-ons** section, choose one of the EVault options (other than "None").
6. At the bottom of the page, click **Add to Order**. The Checkout page is displayed.

9. Confirm or enter your payment information and click **Submit Order**. You are redirected to a screen with your provisioning order number. You can print the screen because it's also your provisioning order receipt. <br/>**Note**: You can also save this order without purchasing by clicking **Save as Quote**.

A series of emails are sent to your administrator: acknowledgment of the provisioning order, provisioning order approval and processing, and provisioning complete. The provisioning complete email includes a link to your *Device Details* page after you login to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can also log directly in to the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}.

## Accessing and viewing EVault backup storage details in {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}

Storage details regarding your EVault backup service may be viewed using the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} at any time. Details that may be viewed include the password, storage address and usage associated with the selected EVault backup service. 

1. To access the **EVault Backup Storage** screen in the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} log in using your unique credentials.
2. Click on **Storage** and select **Backup** from the drop-down list.
2. Click anywhere on the row for the desired EVault Backup to view its storage details. From this view, the Password is not visible. Proceed to the next step to view the password associated with your EVault Backup service.
3. Click the **Show** check box next to the **Password** field to view the password for the selected EVault Backup service.

For many {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} products and services, the password storage feature within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} is used solely for storage or tracking of the password and changes made to it within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} aren't applied to the product or service. This is _not_ the case for EVault Backup. Changes made to the EVault Backup password within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} will be made to the service itself. Make changes while keeping in mind that they will impact your service directly. To reset your password, follow the steps in [How to Change an EVault Backup password in the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](/docs/infrastructure/Backup/change-password-evault-backup-service.html).
