# Getting started with EVault Backup services

Backups ensure that your data is safely stored outside of your device and protected if it's lost. EVault backup is an automated agent-based backup system that is managed through the EVault WebCC browser-based management utility, providing users with a method to back up data between servers in one or more data centers on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} Network. Administrators can set backups to follow an hourly, daily, weekly, or custom schedule that targets full systems, specific directories, or even individual files. Extra plug-ins allow for compatibility with software like Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft SQL, and other types of third-party software, and enable users to complete a Bare Metal Restore, when necessary.

## Ordering EVault 

There are two ways to purchase EVault backup service.

- Purchase EVault when you Order a Server
- Purchase EVault as an Upgrade

### Purchasing EVault when you order a server

1. Log in to [The IBM Cloud catalog](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/){:new_window} or the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}
2. Order a monthly bare metal server. You can learn more about ordering bare metal servers [here](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/bare-metal/baremetal-provision.html){:new_window}.
3. You are redirected to the manage portal to complete the order. <br/>
  **Note**: EVault backup service isn't available when you're ordering an hourly billed server. However, the service can be added later as an upgrade. 
4. Under **Add-ons** section, choose one of the EVault options (other than "None").
6. At the bottom of the page, click **Add to Order**. The check-out page is displayed.
7. On the check-out page, find the Host and Domain Names section and enter host and domain names. You can choose any host name and Domain you like.
8. On the right-hand-side of the check-out page, click the **Cloud Service terms** and the **Third-Party Service Agreement** check boxes.
9. Confirm or enter your payment information and click **Submit Order**. You are redirected to a screen with your provisioning order number. You can print the screen because it's also your provisioning order receipt. <br/>**Note**: You can also save this order without purchasing by clicking **Save as Quote**.

A series of emails is sent to your administrator: Acknowledgment of the provisioning order, Provisioning order approval and processing, and Provisioning complete. The Provisioning complete email includes a link to your *Device Details* page, that you can access after you log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can also log directly in to the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}.

**Confirming the EVault service purchase**
1. In the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}, select **Devices** > **Device List** from the main menu. 
2. Locate the new server that you ordered.
  - If there's clock icon next to the url, you'll need to wait to continue with the EVault purchase confirmation. You can refresh the page to see an updated status on your new server. When the clock icon is no longer present, you can proceed with the next steps to confirm the EVault service purchase.
  - When the clock icon is no longer showing for your server, click the link (the server's url) to go to the **Device Details** page. 
3. Click the **Storage** tab to display the EVault information.
4. Inspect the EVault section, and verify that the size that was selected during the EVault purchase process is displayed next to the EVault link.

### Purchasing EVault as an upgrade

**Select a server on which to install EVault**
1. Log in to [The IBM Cloud catalog](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/){:new_window} or the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}
2. Select **Devices** > **Device List** from the main menu. Find the device for which you want to add EVault service.
3. Click the Device name to go to the Device Details page.

**Adding (purchasing) EVault service**
1. Click the **Storage** tab, and locate the EVault section near the bottom of the page.
2. Click the **Add** link.
3. In the window, select a location, and select a size.
4. Select Payment type, and click **Continue**
5. Enter the **Promo Code** if you have one, and click **Recalculate**.
6. Review your order and click the link to read the terms and conditions.
7. Click the check box if you agree with the terms and conditions.
7. Click **Place Order**.

**Confirming the EVault upgrade purchase**
1. Refresh the **Device Details** page, and ensure that the **Storage** tab is selected.
2. Inspect the EVault section and verify that the size that was selected during the EVault purchase process is displayed next to the EVault link. <br /> **Note**: If the EVault storage size continues to show a capacity of zero, a second page refresh might be needed. 

## Accessing and viewing EVault Backup storage details in {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}

The storage details of your EVault backup service can be viewed on the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} at any time. Details that can be viewed include the password, storage address, and usage that is associated with the selected EVault backup service. 

1. To access the **EVault Backup Storage** screen in the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} log in with your unique credentials.
2. Click **Storage**, and select **Backup** from the list.
2. Click anywhere on the row for the EVault backup vault you want to view its storage details. From this view, the Password is not visible. Proceed to the next step to view the password that is associated with your EVault backup service.
3. Click the **Show** check box next to the **Password** field to view the password for the selected EVault backup service.

For many {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} products and services, the password storage feature within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} is used solely for storage or tracking of the password. For those offerings, the changes that are made to them within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} aren't applied to the product or service. 

It is _not_ the case for EVault backup. Changes that are made to the EVault backup password within the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}} are made to the service itself. When you change your password, keep in mind that it impacts your service directly. To reset your password, follow the steps in [How to Change an EVault Backup password in the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](/docs/infrastructure/Backup/change-password-evault-backup-service.html).
