# How to Upgrade Evault Backup Agent for Windows 

1. Remote into your SoftLayer server that is in need of an Evault upgrade, via RDP.

2. Open Internet Browser, and browse to below URL to download install files:

   - http://downloads.service.softlayer.com/evault/

3. Click the desired file. (For example: Agent-Windows-x64-6-72-1072a.exe)

   **Note**: The version number is in the filename. Most likely you will want the latest. Also there are separate 32 bit and 64 bit installers, if you have a 64 bit Operating System you will want to download the file with x64 in it.

4. Click **Run** at the download screen, and again after it is downloaded.

5. Click **Yes** to perform an upgrade of **Evault Software Agent**.

   **Note**: installer may disappear for a minute while its loading.

6. With **Keep my current registration** selected, click **next**.

7. Click **next** to continue.

   At this point the agent will begin the upgrade process. May take a few minutes.

8. Click **Finish** at the completion screen.
